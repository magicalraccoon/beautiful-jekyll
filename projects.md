**[Tootstream](https://github.com/magicalraccoon/tootstream/)**:
A command line interface for interacting with Mastodon instances. [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social) is a federated social network built to work in conjunction with [GNU social](https://gnu.io/). By not loading embedded media, tootstream is an ideal client for mastodon users with limited bandwidth.
